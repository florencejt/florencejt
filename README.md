## Hi! I’m Florence Townend ☺️

I’m a PhD student at University College London working on AI applied to healthcare.

Specificially my project is: **AI-powered multi-modal data fusion for Motor Neurone Disease prognosis**


### 📓 What’s on my GitHub?

- Ongoing development of PhD software (mostly private due to healthcare data security)
- Notebooks exploring ML applied to public healthcare datasets
- Projects from my undergraduate degree in Engineering Mathematics from University of Bristol

### 🗣️ Languages
- Python: pytorch, pandas, numpy, etc
- MySQL
- MATLAB
- C

### 🌀 Methods
- Deep learning (CNNs, attention mechanisms, VAEs, GANs)
- Traditional ML (SVM, RF)
- Neuroimaging preprocessing
